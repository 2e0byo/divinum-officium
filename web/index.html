			This website was created and designed by the late Laszlo Kiss. Mr. Kiss, longtime
			resident of Forrest Lake, Illinois, died
			suddenly at his home on Monday, 11 July 2011, shortly after returning
			from a walk with his wife Marta. He was three days shy of his 73rd
			birthday. Mr. Kiss was born in Budapest, Hungary, on 14 July 1938, and
			married Marta Noske on 31 January 1968. He worked in Budapest as a
			computer engineer until emigrating to the United States of America in
			1982. In 1983, he developed “Image,” one of the first computer-controlled
			manufacturing systems in the world (still in use to this day). He retired
			in 2000, and, among other things, selflessly devoted hundreds of hours to
			creating this website, which provides free access to many different versions
			of the Divine Office (or <em>breviary</em>), the
			traditional daily prayer book of the Roman Catholic Church. His funeral
			was held at St. Peter's Catholic Church in Volo, Illinois, on the Feast
			of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel (16 July). Mr. Kiss is survived by three
			brothers in Hungary, and in the States by his loving wife Marta (of
			forty-three years), their two sons Zoltan and Chaba, and their two
			grandchildren Sophie and Ryan.

			On Monday, 15 August 2011, the Solemnity of the Assumption of Our Lady, The Divinum Officium
			Project was founded, with the permission of Laszlo's son Chaba, to preserve and further
			Laszlo's work and to promote the worship of the Triune God through the Divine Office. This
			website serves as a historical, educational, as well as spiritual tool for anyone to learn
			about this monument of Christian civilization. Currently, The Divinum Officium Project
			consists of a diocesan priest as well as a team of software developers who maintain the site
			and ensure its accuracy. We are always happy to welcome new volunteers who are familiar with
			the Church's rites and/or Perl programming. Please see our
			<a href="https://github.com/DivinumOfficium/divinum-officium">
				GitHub repository
