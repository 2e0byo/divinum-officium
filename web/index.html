						<p>This website was created and designed by the late Laszlo Kiss. Mr. Kiss, longtime
							resident of Forrest Lake, Illinois, died
							suddenly at his home on Monday, 11 July 2011, shortly after returning
							from a walk with his wife Marta. He was three days shy of his 73rd
							birthday. Mr. Kiss was born in Budapest, Hungary, on 14 July 1938, and
							married Marta Noske on 31 January 1968. He worked in Budapest as a
							computer engineer until emigrating to the United States of America in
							1982. In 1983, he developed “Image,” one of the first computer-controlled
							manufacturing systems in the world (still in use to this day). He retired
							in 2000, and, among other things, selflessly devoted hundreds of hours to
							creating this website, which provides free access to many different versions
							of the Divine Office (or <em>breviary</em>), the
							traditional daily prayer book of the Roman Catholic Church. His funeral
							was held at St. Peter's Catholic Church in Volo, Illinois, on the Feast
							of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel (16 July). Mr. Kiss is survived by three
							brothers in Hungary, and in the States by his loving wife Marta (of
							forty-three years), their two sons Zoltan and Chaba, and their two
							grandchildren Sophie and Ryan.</p>

						<p>
							On Monday, 15 August 2011, the Solemnity of the Assumption of Our Lady, The Divinum Officium
							Project was founded, with the permission of Laszlo's son Chaba, to preserve and further
							Laszlo's work and to promote the worship of the Triune God through the Divine Office. This
							website serves as a historical, educational, as well as spiritual tool for anyone to learn
							about this monument of Christian civilization. Currently, The Divinum Officium Project
							consists of a diocesan priest as well as a team of software developers who maintain the site
							and ensure its accuracy. We are always happy to welcome new volunteers who are familiar with
							the Church's rites and/or Perl programming. Please see our
							<a href="https://github.com/DivinumOfficium/divinum-officium">
								GitHub repository
