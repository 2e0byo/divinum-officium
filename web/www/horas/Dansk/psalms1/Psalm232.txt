(Jomfru Marias lovsang * Luk 1:46-55)
1:46 Min + sjæl * ophøjer Herren,
1:47 Og min ånd fryder sig * over Gud, min frelser! 
1:48 Because he hath regarded the humility of his handmaid; * for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.
1:49 Because he that is mighty, hath done great things to me; * and holy is his name.
1:50 And his mercy is from generation unto generations, * to them that fear him.
1:51 He hath shewed might in his arm: * he hath scattered the proud in the conceit of their heart.
1:52 He hath put down the mighty from their seat, * and hath exalted the humble.
1:53 He hath filled the hungry with good things; * and the rich he hath sent empty away.
1:54 He hath received Israel his servant, * being mindful of his mercy:
1:55 As he spoke to our fathers, * to Abraham and to his seed for ever.
