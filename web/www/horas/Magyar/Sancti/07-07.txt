The brethren Cyril and Methodius were born in an honourable position at~
Thessalonica. As they advanced in years they went to Constantinople to study~
letters in the capital of the Eastern world. Both made quick progress, but most~
chiefly Cyril, who gained such learning that he was called for excellency the~
Philosopher. Methodius became a monk, but the Empress Theodora, on the~
recommendation of the Patriarch Ignatius, deemed Cyril worthy of receiving the~
task of teaching Christianity to the Khazar who dwelt beyond the Crimea. By the~
grace of God he so taught them that they laid aside their many superstitions and~
were joined to Jesus Christ. After properly establishing the new community of~
Christians Cyril hastened back to Constantinople, where he entered the~
monastery of Polychron, whither Methodius had already withdrawn himself.~
Rastilaw, Prince of Moravia, having heard tell of the good deeds beyond the~
Crimea, sent to Constantinople to the Emperor Michael III. to obtain some Gospel~
labourers. Cyril and Methodius were sent to him, and gladly received in Moravia,~
and applied themselves with such power and industry to the work of~
Christianising souls that it was not long before that nation also joyfully~
submitted to Jesus Christ. To this end Cyril found of great use the knowledge of~
the Slavonic language, which he had already acquired, and much effect was~
produced by the translation of holy Scripture which he made into the language of~
the people. Cyril and Methodius were the inventors of the alphabet in which the~
language of the Slavs is characteristically expressed, and for this reason they~
have been not unjustly termed the fathers of Slavonic literature.

[Versum 2]
V. The people will tell of the wisdom of the Saints.
R. And the congregation will show forth their praise.

[Ant 2]
In holiness * and righteousness before Him all the days of their life did they~
serve the Lord, and therefore the Lord God of Israel hath clothed them with a~
robe of glory.

[Versum 3]
V. Let thy Priests be clothed with righteousness.
R. And let thy Saints shout for joy.

[Ant 3]
These are * the holy men become the friends of God and made glorious by the preaching of divine truth; their tongues have become the keys of heaven.

[Lectio94]
Cyril and Methodius were brothers, born of a distinguished family in Thessalonica. The Emperor Michael III sent them into Moravia, where in a short time they brought the nation to the faith of Christ. When a favourable report of what they had done was brought to Rome, Pope St. Nicholas I ordered the brothers to come there. At Rome they were consecrated bishops by Adrian, Nicholas's successor. A short time later, however, Cyril died a most holy death in Rome, and Methodius went back to Moravia and increased his efforts on behalf of Catholicism. Moreover, he confirmed the Bohemians, the Pannonians, the Bulgarians and the Dalmatians in the Christian faith, and worked hard to bring the Corinthians to the worship of the one true God. He also brought the light of the Gospel to Poland and, as some writers say, founded the bishoprick of Lemberg. Then he went to Muscovy properly so called and established the pontifical see of Kiev. At length he came back to Moravia, exhorted the clergy and people to virtue with his last words, and died peacefully. The feast day of Cyril and Methodius, already celebrated by the Slavic peoples, was extended to the universal Church by Leo XIII.
