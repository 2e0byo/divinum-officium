Transfer of Our Holy Father, Dominic; Third Class

[Invit] 
The glad solemnities of Dominic are begun. * Let the church appluad with abundant praise, alleluia. 

[Hymnus Matutinum]
Applaud the Lord's own champion new,
Praise Dominic, sing loud his fame.
His work, the Lord's, his preaching, true,
His life befits his Master's name. 
_
Virginity, in highest fame,
All lily-white he kept unstained;
His zeal burned like a torch aflame,
For souls that Satan else had gained.
_
The world he trod beneath his feet,
And on to rugged toil he pressed;
Unarmed he runs the foe to meet,
By Christ's strong grace unheld and blessed.
_
He sends his brethren through the sphere,
His weapons are the gospel true,
Unceasing prayer and frequent tear,
While miracles his path bestrew.
_
May God the Three and One be praised;
In glory, honour, might and love;
And we to heavenly joy be raised
At Dominic's prayer for us above.
Amen.

[Ant Matutinum]
Foreshadowed, in the likeness of a hound, a new and heaven-sent~
herald in these latter times, Dominic, a poor man, shone afar, alleluia.
Preserving unstained the flower of purity, he attained the freedom of the~
perfect life, alleluia.
Sufficiently, instructured in the literature of the Arts, he passed~
to the persuit of the supreme Truth, alleluia.
