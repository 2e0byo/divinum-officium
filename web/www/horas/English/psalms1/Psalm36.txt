36:1 Far ikke op over forbryderne, * vær ikke misundelig på dem, der øver uret,
36:2 For de visner hurtigt som græsset * og tørrer ud som de grønne vækster.
36:3 Stol på Herren, og gør det gode, * så kan du bo trygt i landet.
36:4 Find din glæde i Herren, * så giver han dig, hvad dit hjerte ønsker.
36:5 Overgiv din vej til Herren, stol på ham, * så griber han ind;
36:6 Han lader din ret bryde frem som lyset og din retfærdighed som den klare dag. * Vær stille over for Herren, vent på ham;
36:7 Far ikke op over den, der har lykken med sig * og får sine planer gennemført.
36:8 Bliv ikke vred, lad din harme fare, * far ikke op, det bringer kun ulykke;
36:9 Thi forbryderne bliver udryddet * men de, der håber på Herren, får landet i arv og eje.
36:10 Kun et øjeblik, så er det ude med den uretfærdige, * ser du efter, hvor han boede, er han der ikke mere. 
36:11 Men de sagtmodige skal få landet i arv og eje * og glæde sig over stor lykke.
36:12 Den uretfærdige spinder rænker mod den retfærdige * og skærer tænder imod ham.
36:13 Herren ler ad ham, * for han ser, at hans time er kommet.
36:14 De uretfærdige drager sværdet * they have bent their bow.
36:14 To cast down the poor and needy, * to kill the upright of heart.
36:15 Let their sword enter into their own hearts, * and let their bow be broken.
36:16 Better is a little to the just, * than the great riches of the wicked.
36:17 For the arms of the wicked shall be broken in pieces; * but the Lord strengtheneth the just.
36:18 The Lord knoweth the days of the undefiled; * and their inheritance shall be for ever.
36:19 They shall not be confounded in the evil time; and in the days of famine they shall be filled, * because the wicked shall perish.
36:20 And the enemies of the Lord, presently after they shall be honoured and exalted, * shall come to nothing and vanish like smoke.
36:21 The sinner shall borrow, and not pay again; * but the just sheweth mercy and shall give.
36:22 For such as bless him shall inherit the land: * but such as curse him shall perish.
36:23 With the Lord shall the steps of a man be directed, * and he shall like well his way.
36:24 When he shall fall he shall not be bruised, * for the Lord putteth his hand under him.
36:25 I have been young, and now am old; * and I have not seen the just forsaken, nor his seed seeking bread.
36:26 He sheweth mercy, and lendeth all the day long; * and his seed shall be in blessing.
36:27 Decline from evil and do good, * and dwell for ever and ever.
36:28 For the Lord loveth judgment, and will not forsake his saints: * they shall be preserved for ever.
36:28 The unjust shall be punished, * and the seed of the wicked shall perish.
36:29 But the just shall inherit the land, * and shall dwell therein for evermore.
36:30 The mouth of the just shall meditate wisdom: * and his tongue shall speak judgment.
36:31 The law of his God is in his heart, * and his steps shall not be supplanted.
36:32 The wicked watcheth the just man, * and seeketh to put him to death.
36:33 But the Lord will not leave him in his hands; * nor condemn him when he shall be judged.
36:34 Expect the Lord and keep his way: and he will exalt thee to inherit the land: * when the sinners shall perish thou shalt see.
36:35 I have seen the wicked highly exalted, * and lifted up like the cedars of Libanus.
36:36 And I passed by, and lo, he was not: * and I sought him and his place was not found.
36:37 Keep innocence, and behold justice: * for there are remnants for the peaceable man.
36:38 But the unjust shall be destroyed together: * the remnants of the wicked shall perish.
36:39 But the salvation of the just is from the Lord, * and he is their protector in the time of trouble.
36:40 And the Lord will help them and deliver them: * and he will rescue them from the wicked, and save them, because they have hoped in him.
