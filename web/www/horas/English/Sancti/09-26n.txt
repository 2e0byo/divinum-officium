[Oratio]
O God. You have consecrated the first fruits of the Faith in the northern parts of America by the preaching and blood shed by Your holy Martyrs, Isaac, John and their Companions; grant, we beseech You, in Your mercy and through their intercession, that the fruitful harvest of Christians may increase everywhere from day to day.
