[Lectio9]
It is Catholic language to say, "Father and Son," but we cannot and must not say that the Father and the Son are two gods. And that, not because the Son of God is not by Himself God yea, He is Very God of Very God but because we know that the Son of God is not from elsewhere, but from the One Father Himself, and therefore we say that God is One. This is the doctrine which Prophets and Apostles have delivered this is the doctrine which the Lord Himself taught when He said, "I and the Father are One," (John x. 30,) that is, He meant, as touching the one Divine Being, but as touching Persons, We are distinct.
