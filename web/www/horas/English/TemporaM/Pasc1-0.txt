Continuation ++ of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 20. 19-31
At that time, when it was late that same day, the first of the week, and the~
doors were shut, where the disciples were gathered together for fear of the Jews,~
Jesus came, and stood in the midst and said to them: Peace be to you. And when~
He had said this, He showed them His hands and His side. The disciples therefore~
were glad, when they saw the Lord. He said therefore to them again: Peace be to~
you. As the Father hath sent Me, I also send you. When He had said this, He~
breathed on them, and He said to them: Receive ye the Holy Ghost: whose sins you~
shall forgive, they are forgiven them; and whose sins you shall retain, they are~
retained. Now Thomas, one of the Twelve, who is called Didymus, was not with~
them when Jesus came. The other disciples therefore said to him: We have seen~
the Lord. But he said to them: Except I shall see in His hands the print of the~
nails, and put my finger into the place of the nails, and put my hand into His~
side, I will not believe. And after eight days, again His disciples were within,~
and Thomas with them. Jesus cometh, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst,~
and said: Peace be to you. Then He saith to Thomas: Put in thy finger hither, and~
see My hands, and bring hither thy hand, and put into My side; and be not~
faithless, but believing. Thomas answered and said to Him: my Lord and my God.~
Jesus saith to him: Because thou hast seen Me, Thomas, thou hast believed;~
blessed are they that have not seen, and have believed. Many other signs also~
did Jesus in the sight of His disciples, which are not written in this book. But~
these are written, that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God;~
and that, believing, you may have life in His Name.
