#Canticle of the Blessed Virgin Mary
!Luke I
My soul glorifies the Lord * my spirit rejoices in God, my Saviour. 
_
He looks on his servant in her nothingness; henceforth all ages will call me blessed.
_
The Almighty works marvels for me. * Holy his name! 
_
His mercy is from age to age, * on those who fear him.
_
He puts forth his arm in strength * and scatters the proud-hearted. 
_
He casts the mighty from their thrones * and raised the lowly. 
_
He fills the starving with good things, * sends the rich away empty. 
_
He protects Israel, his servant, * remembering his mercy, the mercy he promised to our fathers, * for Abraham and his son for ever.
&Gloria
